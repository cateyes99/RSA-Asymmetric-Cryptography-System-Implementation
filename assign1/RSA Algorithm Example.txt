RSA Algorithm Example 
•	Choose two prime numbers p = 3 and q = 11 
•	Compute n = p * q = 3 * 11 = 33 
•	Compute φ(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1) = 2 * 10 = 20 
•	Choose e such that 1 < e < φ(n) and e and n are coprime. Let e = 7 
•	Compute a value for d such that (d * e) % φ(n) = 1. One solution is d = 3 [(3 * 7) % 20 = 1] 
•	Public key is (e, n) => (7, 33) 
•	Private key is (d, n) => (3, 33) 
•	The encryption of m = 2 is c = 27 % 33 = 29
•	The decryption of c = 29 is m = 293 % 33 = 2
